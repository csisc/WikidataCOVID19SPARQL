# WikidataCOVID19SPARQL
A project to represent and visualize COVID-19 information in Wikidata

## Description
In this research project, we investigate the ability of open license knowledge graphs to represent COVID-19 information in a fully structured format and to visualize a synthesis of the obtained information using SPARQL. Our study mainly regards the evaluation of this assumption for COVID-19 information in Wikidata. This GitHub repository involves two folders including information supporting the results of this work:
* "Docs": This folder includes the source data of several figures and tables of the study
* "Query": This folder involves sample SPARQL queries developed for the visualization of COVID-19 information in Wikidata. These SPARQL queries are visualized at https://speed.ieee.tn.
