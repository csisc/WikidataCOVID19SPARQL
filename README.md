# WikidataCOVID19SPARQL
A project to visualize and validate COVID-19 information in Wikidata

## Description
In this research project, we investigate the ability of SPARQL as a semantic query service to identify the inconsistencies of knowledge graphs and to visualize a synthesis of the information it involves. Our study mainly regards the evaluation of this assumption for COVID-19 information in Wikidata. This GitHub repository involves two folders including information supporting the results of this work:
* "Tables": This folder includes the source data of the tables of the study
* "Queries": This folder involves several SPARQL queries developed for the paper
